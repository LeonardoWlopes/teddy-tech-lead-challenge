# Project Estimation

This document provides estimations regarding the development resources required to build this application from scratch.

## Development Resources

### Time Estimation

- **Minimum Time**: 4 working days
- **Recommended Time**: 5 working days
- **With Buffer**: 7 working days (includes time for unexpected issues and thorough QA)

The additional time in the recommended approach allows for:

- More extensive testing
- Better documentation
- Handling unforeseen technical challenges
- Code reviews and refinements

### Team Composition

#### Minimal Team

- **1 Senior Developer** (full-stack capabilities)

OR

- **1 Advanced Mid-level Developer** with experience in both React and NestJS

#### Optimal Team

- **1 Mid to Senior Frontend Developer** (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS)
- **1 Mid to Senior Backend Developer** (NestJS, TypeORM, PostgreSQL)

### Required Experience and Skills

#### Senior Developer (Full-stack)

- Strong TypeScript skills
- Experience with Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture
- Experience with Docker and containerization
- Experience with monorepo setups (Turborepo/NX/etc.)
- Understanding of database design and ORM usage

#### Mid-level Developer (Advanced)

- Good understanding of TypeScript
- Familiarity with architectural patterns
- Basic DevOps knowledge (Docker, CI/CD)
- Experience with testing frameworks

## Project Complexity Factors

The complexity of this project comes from:

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Setting up and configuring Turborepo with proper workspaces
2. **Clean Architecture**: Implementing proper separation of concerns in the backend
3. **Modern Frontend**: Implementing React with the latest patterns and libraries
4. **Containerization**: Setting up Docker for development and production

## Conclusion

This application can realistically be built by a single skilled senior or advanced mid-level developer within 4 days. However, for better quality and to allow time for addressing potential issues, the recommended approach is to allocate 5 days of development time.

For critical business applications or when additional features might be requested during development, a team of two developers (frontend and backend specialists) would be more efficient and provide better quality outcomes.
